Fhenix is a flexible and lightweight tool for generating content from a modeling
of a [FHIR] IG's definitional entries.

This leverages packages as defined in the [Simplifier registry], parses their
relevant entities ([`StructureDefinition`], [`CodeSystem`], and
[`ValueSet`]), constructs a model of these entities, and then feeds it into Go
templates to generate content.

Check out our [examples](./examples)!

## Use

This tool is intended for producing content off of modeled FHIR definitional
resources. This can be used for:

* Code generation, to create custom bindings for organizational profiles
* Documentation generation, to create custom documentation for IGs
* Data generation, to create test data based on profiles

Some practical projects leveraging this within [Friendly FHIR]:

* [`go-fhir`](https://github.com/friendly-fhir/go-fhir):
  A Go library for working with FHIR resources
* [`fhir-jsonschema`](https://github.com/friendly-fhir/fhir-jsonschema):
  Hosting of FHIR [JSON Schema] definitions
